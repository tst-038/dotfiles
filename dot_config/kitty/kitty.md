```

### Linux

1. Locate the kitty logos in `/usr/lib/kitty/logo`
2. Backup existing `kitty.png` & `kitty-128.png` (may need to do this as root, depending on how you installed kitty)
3. Locate your favourite variant in `build/`
4. Copy `icon_128x128.png` to `/usr/lib/kitty/logo` rename to `kitty-128.png`
